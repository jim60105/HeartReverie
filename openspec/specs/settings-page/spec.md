# Settings Page

## Purpose

Dedicated settings page with sidebar navigation and content area for application configuration panels (prompt editor, future settings tabs).

## Requirements

### Requirement: Settings layout with sidebar and content area

The application SHALL provide a `SettingsLayout.vue` component that renders a left sidebar (~200px width) and a content area. The sidebar SHALL contain tab navigation links and a back-to-reader button. The content area SHALL render a `<router-view />` for nested child routes. `SettingsLayout.vue` SHALL be lazy-loaded as the component for the `/settings` parent route.

#### Scenario: Settings layout renders sidebar and content area
- **WHEN** the user navigates to any `/settings/*` route
- **THEN** `SettingsLayout.vue` SHALL render a left sidebar (~200px) and a content area containing the matched child route's component via `<router-view />`

#### Scenario: Sidebar is fixed width on desktop
- **WHEN** the settings page is displayed on a viewport 768px or wider
- **THEN** the sidebar SHALL have a fixed width of approximately 200px and the content area SHALL fill the remaining horizontal space

### Requirement: Sidebar tab navigation with router-link active state

The sidebar SHALL render navigation items as `<router-link>` elements pointing to each settings child route. The active tab SHALL be visually indicated using Vue Router's `active-class` (or `exact-active-class`) prop to apply a highlight style. Sidebar items SHALL be driven by the route configuration (e.g., iterating over the `/settings` route's `children` array or a derived list), making the tab system extensible without modifying the sidebar template.

#### Scenario: Active tab is visually highlighted
- **WHEN** the user is on `/settings/prompt-editor`
- **THEN** the "Prompt Editor" sidebar link SHALL have the active CSS class applied, visually distinguishing it from inactive tabs

#### Scenario: Sidebar items driven by route config
- **WHEN** a new child route is added to the `/settings` route definition
- **THEN** the sidebar SHALL render a corresponding navigation link without requiring changes to `SettingsLayout.vue`'s template

#### Scenario: Clicking a tab navigates to the child route
- **WHEN** the user clicks a sidebar tab link
- **THEN** Vue Router SHALL navigate to the corresponding child route and the content area SHALL render the matched component

### Requirement: Back-to-reader navigation

The sidebar SHALL include a `← 返回閱讀` back button at the top. Clicking the button SHALL exit the `/settings/*` area in a single navigation, regardless of the user's intra-settings tab history.

The frontend SHALL maintain an in-memory record of the **last reading route** the user occupied — defined as the most recently navigated-to route whose path is **none of**: exactly `/settings`, starting with `/settings/`, exactly `/tools`, or starting with `/tools/`. (A loose `startsWith("/settings")` or `startsWith("/tools")` predicate MUST NOT be used: it would mis-classify valid top-level reading paths whose first segment merely starts with the literal substring `settings` or `tools`, such as a series slug `settings-archive` rendered at `/settings-archive/my-story` or `tools-archive` rendered at `/tools-archive/my-story`.) The record SHALL be updated by a `router.afterEach` global navigation guard installed once at application bootstrap, and the guard MUST be registered BEFORE the router-induced initial navigation completes (i.e., before `app.use(router)`) so that direct entry to a reading URL is captured. The record SHALL store the route's portable identifier (`name`, `params`, `query`, and `hash`; or `path`, `query`, and `hash` as a defensive fallback for unnamed routes), NOT a fullPath string. The record SHALL be in-memory only (it is not persisted across page reloads or browser sessions).

When the user clicks `← 返回閱讀`:
- If a last reading route has been recorded, the application SHALL call `router.push()` with the recorded route location.
- If no last reading route has been recorded (e.g., the user opened a `/settings/*` URL directly with no prior reading navigation in this SPA session), the application SHALL navigate to `/` (the home route) as the fallback.

The button SHALL NOT call `router.back()` and SHALL NOT walk browser history in any form. Browser back/forward buttons remain governed by Vue Router's default history behavior — only the in-app back button is destination-driven.

The same captured record SHALL be reused by any future `← 返回閱讀` control hosted under `/tools/*` (e.g. inside `ToolsLayout`'s sidebar). The capture predicate is shared; only the consumer surface differs.

#### Scenario: Back button returns to last reading route after intra-settings navigation

- **WHEN** the user navigates `/storyA/storyB/chapter/3` → `/settings/prompt-editor` → `/settings/lore` → `/settings/llm` and then clicks `← 返回閱讀`
- **THEN** the application SHALL navigate to `/storyA/storyB/chapter/3` in a single transition, without passing through `/settings/lore` or `/settings/prompt-editor`

#### Scenario: Back button returns to home when no reading route was recorded

- **WHEN** the user opens `/settings/llm` as the first route in the SPA session (e.g., direct URL entry, fresh page load) and clicks `← 返回閱讀`
- **THEN** the application SHALL navigate to `/` (home) as the fallback

#### Scenario: Last reading route is updated when the user re-enters reading then re-enters settings

- **WHEN** the user navigates `/` → `/settings/llm` → `/storyA` → `/settings/lore` and then clicks `← 返回閱讀`
- **THEN** the application SHALL navigate to `/storyA` (the most recent non-`/settings` and non-`/tools` route), not to `/`

#### Scenario: Settings tab navigation does not overwrite the last reading route

- **WHEN** the user navigates `/storyA` → `/settings/prompt-editor` → `/settings/llm`
- **THEN** the recorded last reading route SHALL still be `/storyA` after the second settings navigation, because neither `/settings/prompt-editor` nor `/settings/llm` matches the reading-route criterion (their paths start with `/settings/`)

#### Scenario: Tools navigation does not overwrite the last reading route

- **WHEN** the user navigates `/storyA` → `/tools/new-series` → `/tools/import-character-card`
- **THEN** the recorded last reading route SHALL still be `/storyA` after the tools navigations, because both `/tools/new-series` and `/tools/import-character-card` have paths that start with `/tools/`

#### Scenario: Crossing between settings and tools does not overwrite the last reading route

- **WHEN** the user navigates `/storyA` → `/settings/prompt-editor` → `/tools/new-series` → `/settings/llm`
- **THEN** the recorded last reading route SHALL still be `/storyA`, because none of the three intermediate paths satisfies the reading-route criterion

#### Scenario: Top-level paths whose first segment starts with the substring `settings` ARE reading routes

- **WHEN** the user navigates to a story-shaped path such as `/settings-archive/my-story` (which matches the `story` route, NOT a settings route)
- **THEN** the navigation guard SHALL record this route as a reading route (because its path is neither exactly `/settings` nor starts with `/settings/`, and is neither exactly `/tools` nor starts with `/tools/`)

#### Scenario: Top-level paths whose first segment starts with the substring `tools` ARE reading routes

- **WHEN** the user navigates to a story-shaped path such as `/tools-archive/my-story` (which matches the `story` route, NOT a tools route)
- **THEN** the navigation guard SHALL record this route as a reading route (because its path is neither exactly `/tools` nor starts with `/tools/`)

#### Scenario: Captured route shape is portable

- **WHEN** the navigation guard captures a reading route
- **THEN** the captured value SHALL be an object exposing at minimum `name`, `params`, `query`, and `hash`, suitable as input to `router.push()`, rather than a raw fullPath string

### Requirement: Settings route redirect to first tab

The `/settings` route (without a child path) SHALL redirect to the first available settings tab. Initially, this SHALL redirect to `/settings/prompt-editor`. The redirect SHALL be defined in the route configuration, not in `SettingsLayout.vue` component logic.

#### Scenario: Bare settings path redirects
- **WHEN** the user navigates to `/settings`
- **THEN** Vue Router SHALL redirect to `/settings/prompt-editor`

#### Scenario: Redirect defined in route config
- **WHEN** the `/settings` route definition is inspected
- **THEN** the redirect SHALL be declared as a `redirect` property on the parent route object, not as imperative navigation in a component

### Requirement: Extensible tab registration

The settings tab system SHALL be extensible by adding new child routes to the `/settings` parent route. Each child route SHALL declare a `meta` object containing at minimum a `title` (string, used as the sidebar display text), and MAY declare a `category` (string, used to group sibling tabs in the sidebar). The sidebar component SHALL derive its navigation items from the route children's `meta.title` values, ensuring new tabs can be added without modifying the sidebar component.

The sidebar component SHALL bucket sibling tabs by `meta.category`. Children with no `category` (or `category: "general"`) SHALL appear in the default "一般 / General" group at the top of the sidebar. Children with `category: "developer-tools"` SHALL appear in a separate "開發者工具 / Developer Tools" group rendered below the default group. Additional categories MAY be added in future without changes to the sidebar component, provided the sidebar maps the category key to a human-readable group label (a small static map within the component is acceptable; falling back to the raw category key when no label is mapped is acceptable).

Within each category group, tabs SHALL appear in the order defined by the children array in the route configuration.

No second authentication gate (such as a `?dev=1` query string) SHALL be required for developer-tools category tabs. The passphrase gate remains the sole auth boundary for the entire writer SPA.

#### Scenario: New tab added via route config only
- **WHEN** a developer adds a new child route `{ path: 'appearance', component: AppearancePage, meta: { title: '外觀設定' } }` to the `/settings` route
- **THEN** the sidebar SHALL automatically render a "外觀設定" link pointing to `/settings/appearance` under the default "一般" group without any template changes

#### Scenario: Tab order follows route definition order
- **WHEN** multiple child routes are defined under `/settings` within the same `meta.category`
- **THEN** the sidebar SHALL render those tabs in the same order as the children array in the route configuration

#### Scenario: Developer-tools category renders as a separate group
- **WHEN** a child route is registered with `meta.category: "developer-tools"`
- **THEN** the sidebar SHALL render that tab inside a "開發者工具 / Developer Tools" group separate from the default "一般 / General" group, and the developer-tools group SHALL render BELOW the default group

#### Scenario: Default group is shown when no category is declared
- **WHEN** a child route declares `meta` without a `category` field
- **THEN** the sidebar SHALL render that tab inside the default "一般 / General" group

#### Scenario: No second auth gate for developer tabs
- **WHEN** a user has passed the passphrase gate and navigates to a developer-tools tab
- **THEN** the SPA SHALL render the tab without requiring any additional query parameter, header, or confirmation

### Requirement: Hook Inspector settings tab

The settings area SHALL include a child route at `/settings/hook-inspector` with `meta.title` set to a Traditional Chinese label (e.g. `Hook 檢視`) and `meta.category` set to `"developer-tools"`. The route SHALL lazy-load `HookInspectorPage.vue` from `reader-src/src/components/`. Behavioural details (fetch URL, conflict detection, error reporting, refresh behavior, etc.) are specified by the `hook-inspector` capability; this requirement only governs the route registration and sidebar placement.

#### Scenario: Hook Inspector route registered with developer-tools category
- **WHEN** the `/settings/hook-inspector` child route is registered
- **THEN** its `meta` SHALL include `{ title: <zh-TW label>, category: "developer-tools" }` and the sidebar SHALL render the link under the "開發者工具 / Developer Tools" group described in the modified "Extensible tab registration" requirement

### Requirement: LLM settings tab per story

The settings area SHALL include a new tab registered as a child route of `/settings` at path `llm` (resolving to `/settings/llm`) with `meta.title` set to a Traditional Chinese label such as `LLM 設定`. The route SHALL lazy-load a new `LlmSettingsPage.vue` component. The page SHALL allow the user to select an existing story and edit its LLM parameter overrides (`model`, `temperature`, `frequencyPenalty`, `presencePenalty`, `topK`, `topP`, `repetitionPenalty`, `minP`, `topA`). Each field SHALL render a "use default" toggle; when the toggle is ON, the field SHALL be omitted from the request body sent by Save, and the env default SHALL therefore apply at chat time. Loading and saving SHALL go through a new `useStoryLlmConfig` composable wrapping `GET` and `PUT /api/:series/:name/config`. API errors SHALL be surfaced through the existing toast notification mechanism. All user-facing text SHALL be in Traditional Chinese (zh-TW) to match the rest of the frontend.

#### Scenario: Sidebar exposes the LLM settings tab via route config
- **WHEN** the `/settings/llm` child route is registered with `meta.title: 'LLM 設定'`
- **THEN** the sidebar SHALL render a "LLM 設定" link pointing to `/settings/llm` without any changes to the sidebar template

#### Scenario: Page loads current overrides for the selected story
- **GIVEN** the user is on `/settings/llm` and selects a story whose `_config.json` contains `{ "temperature": 0.7 }`
- **WHEN** the page finishes loading the story config
- **THEN** the temperature field SHALL display `0.7` with its "use default" toggle OFF, and every other field's "use default" toggle SHALL be ON

#### Scenario: Save sends only non-default fields
- **GIVEN** the user has toggled "use default" OFF only for temperature and entered `0.3`
- **WHEN** the user clicks the Save button
- **THEN** the frontend SHALL issue `PUT /api/:series/:name/config` with body `{ "temperature": 0.3 }` and SHALL NOT include any other LLM field

#### Scenario: Toggling "use default" on removes the field on save
- **GIVEN** the form currently has temperature loaded as `0.9` with its "use default" toggle OFF
- **WHEN** the user toggles the temperature "use default" toggle ON and clicks Save
- **THEN** the frontend SHALL issue `PUT /api/:series/:name/config` with body `{}`

#### Scenario: API error surfaces through toast notifications
- **WHEN** the Save request returns a non-2xx response
- **THEN** the page SHALL show an error toast using the existing toast notification mechanism and SHALL leave the form values unchanged so the user can retry

### Requirement: Settings layout caps its height to the viewport on the prompt-editor route

The global stylesheet (`reader-src/src/styles/base.css`) SHALL declare a route-scoped rule that caps the `.settings-layout` element's height to exactly the visible viewport whenever a descendant `.editor-page` element is present in the DOM (i.e., the user is on `/settings/prompt-editor`). The rule SHALL use the `:has()` selector with the duplicated class chain `.settings-layout.settings-layout:has(.editor-page)` to raise specificity above `SettingsLayout.vue`'s scoped `.settings-layout { min-height: 100vh; }` rule (a plain `.settings-layout:has(.editor-page)` selector has the same specificity as the scoped class rule, so on mobile where `100vh > 100dvh` the un-neutralized `min-height` could win and re-introduce page scroll). The rule SHALL declare `height: 100vh; height: 100dvh;` (the second value is preferred on browsers that support `dvh`; the first is a fallback) together with `min-height: 0` (to neutralize the inherited `min-height: 100vh`) and `overflow: hidden`.

When the user is on a different settings route (e.g., `/settings/lore`, `/settings/llm`), the rule MUST NOT apply: `.settings-layout` retains its existing `min-height: 100vh` and the page may grow past the viewport with the document body acting as the scroll container, exactly as today. This change is strictly additive and route-scoped; other settings tabs are not affected.

The mobile breakpoint (≤767px) SHALL apply the same route-scoped cap. The sidebar stacks above the content on mobile, but on the prompt-editor route the combined element MUST still fit within `100dvh` so that the document body remains non-scrolling.

#### Scenario: Route-scoped cap rule is declared in base.css

- **WHEN** the project's global stylesheet `reader-src/src/styles/base.css` is read as text
- **THEN** it SHALL contain a rule whose selector is `.settings-layout.settings-layout:has(.editor-page)` (the duplicated class chain raises specificity above `SettingsLayout.vue`'s scoped `.settings-layout` rule)
- **AND** the rule's declarations SHALL include `height: 100vh`, `height: 100dvh`, `min-height: 0`, and `overflow: hidden`

#### Scenario: Cap does not apply when the editor page is not in the DOM

- **WHEN** `.settings-layout` has no descendant element with class `.editor-page` (e.g., the user is on `/settings/lore` or `/settings/llm`)
- **THEN** the `:has(.editor-page)` rule SHALL NOT match `.settings-layout`
- **AND** `.settings-layout` keeps its existing `min-height: 100vh` from `SettingsLayout.vue`'s scoped style block (verified by manual browser smoke; not unit-testable in Happy DOM)

#### Scenario: Document body does not scroll on the prompt-editor route (manual smoke)

- **GIVEN** the route-scoped cap rule is in effect on `/settings/prompt-editor`
- **WHEN** the routed content's natural height exceeds the viewport
- **THEN** the document body SHALL NOT produce a vertical scrollbar
- **AND** the `.settings-layout` root element SHALL be sized to the viewport height (validated by manual browser smoke; Happy DOM does not perform layout)

### Requirement: Theme settings tab

The settings area SHALL include a new tab registered as a child route of `/settings` at path `theme` (resolving to `/settings/theme`) with `meta.title` set to a Traditional Chinese label `主題`. The route SHALL lazy-load a new `ThemeSettingsPage.vue` component. The page SHALL render a `<select>` populated from `GET /api/themes` and SHALL bind change events to `useTheme().selectTheme(id)`, which persists the selection to `localStorage` and applies the new theme to `document.documentElement`. All user-facing text SHALL be in Traditional Chinese (zh-TW) to match the rest of the frontend.

#### Scenario: Sidebar exposes the theme tab via route config
- **WHEN** the `/settings/theme` child route is registered with `meta.title: '主題'`
- **THEN** the existing settings sidebar SHALL render a tab labelled `主題` linking to `/settings/theme` without any sidebar-component code change (per the existing "Extensible tab registration" requirement)

#### Scenario: Theme dropdown lists all themes from the backend
- **GIVEN** `GET /api/themes` returns `[{"id":"default","label":"浮心夜夢"},{"id":"light","label":"日光"},{"id":"dark","label":"暗夜"}]`
- **WHEN** the user navigates to `/settings/theme`
- **THEN** the page SHALL render a `<select>` containing exactly those three options with the labels shown to the user

#### Scenario: Selecting a theme applies it and persists the choice
- **GIVEN** the user is on `/settings/theme`
- **WHEN** the user changes the selection from `default` to `light`
- **THEN** `document.documentElement.style.getPropertyValue("--text-main")` SHALL update to the `light` theme's value, AND `localStorage.getItem("heartReverie.themeId")` SHALL equal `"light"`

### Requirement: Dynamic plugin settings tabs

The settings page sidebar SHALL dynamically discover plugins that declare `settingsSchema` via the `/api/plugins` endpoint (checking `hasSettings: true`). For each such plugin, the sidebar SHALL render a navigation link using the plugin's `name` as the label, linking to `/settings/plugins/:name`. The settings router SHALL register a wildcard child route at `plugins/:name` that lazy-loads a generic `PluginSettingsPage.vue` component.

#### Scenario: Plugin with settings appears in sidebar

- **WHEN** the user navigates to any `/settings/*` route and a loaded plugin declares `settingsSchema`
- **THEN** the sidebar SHALL display a link labeled with the plugin's name under a "Plugins" section, linking to `/settings/plugins/<pluginName>`

#### Scenario: Plugin settings page renders schema-driven form

- **WHEN** the user navigates to `/settings/plugins/sd-webui-image-gen`
- **THEN** the page SHALL fetch the plugin's settings schema and current values, and render form inputs matching the schema types (text for string, number input for integer/number, select for enum, checkbox for boolean)

#### Scenario: Settings saved via form submission

- **WHEN** the user modifies a field and clicks save on the plugin settings page
- **THEN** the page SHALL PUT the updated values to `/api/plugins/:name/settings` and display a success notification

#### Scenario: Dynamic dropdown options from x-options-url

- **WHEN** a schema field declares `x-options-url: "/api/plugins/sd-webui-image-gen/proxy/sd-models"`
- **THEN** the settings form SHALL fetch that URL and render the response as dropdown `<option>` elements for that field
